# Stochastic-rs

A Rust library for stochastic processes and models. The main goal to provide a simple and easy to use high performance library for stochastic processes and models. This library is still in development and breaking changes may occur. ðŸš§

Minimal documentation is available at [stochastic-rs](https://docs.rs/stochastic-rs/).
